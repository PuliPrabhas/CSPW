      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        The identification of people preferring for shopping is an essential part of everyday life, and consumers can choose between online and offline shopping based on their preferences and needs. Offline shopping refers to purchasing products in physical stores, allowing customers to see, touch, and try items before buying. It provides a personalized shopping experience with direct customer service. On the other hand, online shopping offers convenience, a wider selection of products, and the ability to shop anytime from anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both shopping methods have their advantages and challenges, and consumer choices are influenced by factors such as convenience, product availability, pricing, and personal preferences. In today’s rapidly evolving marketplace, the way consumers choose to shop has undergone a significant transformation. With the proliferation of the internet, smartphones, and digital payment systems, online shopping has emerged as a dominant mode of commerce. At the same time, traditional brick-and-mortar stores continue to serve a substantial portion of the population who still value the in-person shopping experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The competition and coexistence between online and offline shopping channels have given rise to an important question: What drives consumer preference toward one shopping mode over the other? Understanding these preferences is crucial in the modern retail landscape. Businesses, marketers, and policy makers alike benefit from insights into consumer behavior to tailor services, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize sales strategies. Some consumers are drawn to the convenience, speed, and product variety that online platforms provide. Others continue to value the tactile, social, and experiential elements of shopping in physical stores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Factors such as age, income, education level, lifestyle, technological access, and even psychological comfort levels influence these choices. Therefore, identifying who prefers which mode of shopping—and why—is not only relevant but essential for the sustainable growth of both online and offline retail sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption of online shopping. Lockdowns, health concerns, and movement restrictions forced many traditional shoppers to explore digital avenues for their daily needs. E-commerce saw record surges in traffic and transactions during this period. However, with the return to post-pandemic normalcy, the world is witnessing a rebalancing act.
